adftools
--------
* adfcopy can only copy directories recursively. This means you cannot do
  something like "adfcopy * foo.adf" and expect it only to copy the root
  files to the image.

* adfdelete can't handle wildcards.
* adfdelete can't delete recursively.



adflib
------
* Make "unsigned char buf[LOGICAL_BLOCK_SIZE]" (in adf_dump.c) static, else
  there will be garbage in the end of new adf-files  (found 2002-02-24)

* Rewrite the function so it actually writes the bytes, instead of creating
  a file containing holes (using fseek()). Garbage could show up when 
  seeking, but I haven't investigated this deeply yet  (2002-02-25)

* adfMountDev() should return NULL if device type is unknown  (2002-03-05)

* adfOpenFile() truncates the filename to 31 chars, amigados expects a
  filename to be at most 30 characters in length.  (2002-04-06)

* In adfOpenFile() (adf_dir.c), myToUpper() allocates memory for 31 chars
  but overwrites the memory if the filename is bigger. This is a serious
  bug. Solution is to truncate the filename if it exceeds 31 (30?) chars,
  and print a warning.  (2002-04-09)

* When writing files bigger than the amount of free space, NO ERROR IS
  REPORTED! This is a FATAL BUG in adfWriteFile()! (2002-05-27)
